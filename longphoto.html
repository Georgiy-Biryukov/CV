            “The cork composite hand grips are very comfortable for all day use and absorb sweat for a solid grip. The wrist straps … add very solid support with the right amount of padding and breathability for comfort.”

            “These poles are sturdy. The aluminum took a whacking very nicely and comes out with a dent instead of snapping like my old carbon fiber ones.”

            “I changed the pole length at least 15 times over 4 hours and it was quick and easy … The length was perfectly locked and I never worried that the pole would slip or not support me as I went up/down steep inclines.”
